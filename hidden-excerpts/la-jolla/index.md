<h3>I've recently woken up to the text:</h3>

"You will attend a reception at the home of Dr. Jonas Salk on Tuesday night, attend the DFC meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. You will be a fly on the wall during a private meeting to discuss research Wednesday from 9-12."

<h3>Thoughts going through my mind:</h3>

1. Immediate thoughts of self-doubt and what I would (or wouldn't) be able to contribute to a conference full of people who've been in the AEC/Tech industry for years, probably decades.
2. I can't pass up an opportunity to meet incredibly interesting, accomplished and inspiring people.
3. Proper exposure therapy.
