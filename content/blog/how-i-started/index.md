I feel the need to share a brief recount of how I became interested in pursuing a career in tech, and how I made that interest a reality.

<h3>A little about myself:</h3>

I've always had a deep curiosity to learn and excel in school, however, due to certain adversities I was no longer able to complete university and I began exploring alternative education paths. I have always had an interest in computer programming but because of misconceptions that people have to be mathmatical geniuses (even though maths was always my main interest in school) coupled with deep seated internalized fears developed at an early age that I would never be good enough, I put off pursuing it. Despite this extremely inaccurate representation of the tech industry and self, I eventually decided to try it out.

Yay for online resources!

Plan: Get signed to a modeling agency in order to make enough money to live on and be able to have a flexible schedule with enough spare time to teach myself to code.

I started taking a few online coding courses and I was immediately intrigued. I began taking more and more of these courses and I remember the day everything started to 'click' and thinking I may actualy be able to have a career in programming. After a few months of coding for a few hours a day building systems as well as small but practical applications I was feeling more confident technically, but still not where I would like to be. I was not sure how I'd ever get hired/taken seriously as a female without a CS degree.

I live in a sort of co-op graduate student house where we have a constant cycle of people staying for various lengths of times. To keep the rent paid when we do not have permanent housemates we also Airbnb a few of the rooms. Because we live fairly close to University of California Berkeley we have many interesting people passing through. These people range from professors to nomads. Thanks to Airbnb I eventualy met a Blaine Wishart who happened to be in the tech industry for 30+ years and was looking for someone such as myself. He was looking for someone to help out with more of the coding as he was putting more of his time and energy into software design and architecture.

He had offered to meet for coffee to talk about details of a project he was currently working on. He ended up giving me what I felt was a considerable task to do in two weeks. I was to get back to him when I had done so. I knew I was in over my head but long story short I ended up building a database he had wanted (with lots of help from Google and StackOverflow) in a few days with the software he was interested in and he was impressed - because of this he hired me into a sort of junior position.

<h3>Most important things I learned on the job:</h3>

1. Learn as much as you can from the people around you and do not be shy when doing so. Believe it or not, they want to help you!
2. Do not underestimate your abilities.

I learned more during these several months pair programming with Blaine and soaking up as much information as I could from the rest of our distributed team members (two in India, a team in Australia, one in China, and one in California, as well as our client's team in Texas). I was given an opportunity to learn from people who have worked for major tech companies and I wanted to take advantage of this. I acquired invaluable technical skills as well as truly understanding the importance of teamwork. I learned the intricacies and centrality of clear and consistent communication with one another, this seemed especially true in a distributed team.

Our team was contracted with a large architecture firm to build multiple MVPs. The software was based on React GraphQL, JavaScript, and relational databases. We used GitLab for a development platform and deployed with Zeit. These applications addressed and organized management of financial and human resource budgets for large construction projects, including billion-dollar stadiums.

As I came into the project some months after the rest of the team had started I was expected to get up to speed with the tools and libraries used as well as the overarching conceptual models. Blaine threw me in head first where I would be working with a real company, attending real Zoom meetings filled with real important people. Through this I learned skills I would never be able to acquire by getting a CS degree or attending a bootcamp for that I am eternally grateful.

Blaine and I have different backgrounds, skillsets, ages, and perspectives, allowing us to approach both problems and solutions in a creative way.
