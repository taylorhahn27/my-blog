(5) Lessons I've learned from the first iteration of the restaurant website I have been building.

1. Always create wire frames that can be discussed and agreed upon with the client beforehand. (Quick sketches are fine.)
2. If you are working with a Web Designer, make sure you both have clear expectations of what the other will provide.
   1. If you are doing both the web design and development still make sure what expectations both you and the client have.
3. If you are getting paid for this job, agree on the amount and terms prior (if you are working with family this becomes a bit tricky.
   1. have 3 payment installments, both so you have money in your bank account and so it is impossible to get ripped off. (I learned this tip the other day along with many others from the podcast ['Start Here: Web Development' by Dain Miller](https://starthere.fm/), Episode 'FREELANCERS PAY ATTENTION - How To Avoid Being Ripped Off'. Highly recommend this podcast!)
4. Discuss and schedule check-in points. Communication is key.
   1. Try not to get discouraged if you receive negative feedback. It is not personal.
5. Fast iterations with feedback are ALWAYS better than slow iterations with no feedback at all.

These key points will progress your project quickly for everyone involved.
