Although it is easy to stay isolated with your eyes glued to the blue screen for 24 hours straight trying to solve some coding issue (with intermediate bursts of shouting trying to reason with the little person living inside of your computer), I find taking a break and working on something other than programming helps being able to think more clearly.

My something as of late has been digital illustrations on Procreate. My job luckily gifted me an ipad at the beginning of the year. I've since fallen in love with the tool for both work and personal projects.

Here are a few of my illustrations that I've done in the last week:

Since I was a youngster I've found human interaction fascinating, which led into portrait sketchings/paintings. Retrospectively thinking, I believe my social anxiety has helped me become extremely perceptive when drawing (I've been told I notice things many would not, especially when it comes to other humans). I would then tweak what I see into freeform quick/short-stroke expressionistic portraits. However, lately I've developed a simple illustrative fine-lined style that I am really into.

I enjoy digital art for many reasons but the main being no clean up (!!!! !!!! x100), access to every tool in the world (wut wut), easy digital documentation (hello social media- if you're into that sort of thing ;)), and consistency (not worrying about varying backgrounds/tools, creating a consistent style and/or series). I haven't used any digital tools other than Procreate thus far, as I've just started getting into digital art.

If anyone recommends any other tools, or can send me interesting photos they'd like drawn, I would appreciate it :).

The series I am currently focusing on consists of:<br>

1. two people
2. interesting poses/shapes
3. relational ambiguity
