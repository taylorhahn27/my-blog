I've recently woken up to the text:

"You will attend a reception at the home of Dr. Jonas Salk on Tuesday night, attend the DFC meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. You will be a fly on the wall during a private meeting to discuss research Wednesday from 9-12."

Thoughts going through my mind:

1. I've never been to a work conference before.
2. I've always wanted to go to a work conference.
3. Why have I always wanted to go to a work conference?
4. Immediate thoughts of self-doubt and what I would (or wouldn't more so) be able to contribute to a conference full of people who've been in the A/E/C industry for years, probably decades.
5. I can't pass up an opportunity to meet extremely interesting and inspiring people.
6. This will be a good way to challenge my social anxiety.. after all, I've been told the only way to combat social anxiety is through exposure therapy.

A good way to start the new year :-)
