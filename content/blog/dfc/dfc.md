### Rough notes on [Design Futures Counsil Leadership Summit on Technology & Applied Innovation - Game Changers 2020](https://www.di-technology-innovation.com/)

Overarching themes that bled through all days:

1. Sustainability and taking responsibility (being the one to make the change, owning you can make a difference)
2. 0 carbon cities ([Dark Matter Labs](https://darkmatterlabs.org/Healthy-Clean-Cities-Deep-Demonstration-Accelerating-European-cities))
3. Climate change (in relation to A/E/C industry (Architecture, Engineering, Construction))
4. Circular construction (“an economic concept whose objective is that the value of products, materials and resources is kept in the economy for as long as possible, and that waste generation is minimized.”)
5. Rather than fighting over crumbs of an existing market, build a new
   market- a new cake, and get a bigger piece of that cake.
6. "the boring revolution” (the long, possibly painstaking revolution that is necessary to change and develop the root cause of poor tech implementation in A/E/C - "trying to use 20th century technology within 19th century frameworks")
7. Deep focus on including and hearing from the new generation

I will be writing a more in-depth article elaborating on the ideas, humans, and brilliance I was immersed in during this conference but for now, here is a brief recap on the main ideas that stood out to me.

I came into this conference knowing absolutely nothing other than that the topic was technology innovation relating to A/E/C. I was completely blown away by what took place. I met some of the most accomplished humans, and to be in a room filled with such beings felt incredibly validating and powerful. I awkwardly drank wine on the porch of Sulk's family home, I shook hands with Dr. Jonas Sulk’s son.

What I observed from the 14th to the 16th at the DFC conference is what I believe should be happening in every industry, classroom, and household globally. It was a bold display of all generations voicing an immediate need for reform of industry policies and changing one's mindset regarding sustainability issues.

As I was on my way to the airport to catch a flight home I couldn’t help but feel a sense of restored/renewed faith in the goodness of humanity. Knowing that people are willing to call out people who have influence/power to actually make such changes, or at least start the process of change.

Of course, this is a very select group of people, and I in no way suddenly feel safe thinking that the world will no longer overheat and the salmon won’t go extinct in 20 years - but what it did prove to me, and hopefully others who were there was that it is possible to communicate constructively and have concerns and solutions be heard across generations. It demonstrated that standing up for the world as a whole is just as much a personal issue as it is a global issue.

As was reiterated throughout the several day conference, these people don’t need to make more money — they are perfectly financially secure, but what they do need to think about is their legacy. What will they leave behind to their children and their children's children (if their children have the courage to bring other humans into a dying world)? We can both make changes and make money by creating a new market, a sustainable market.

This conference has inspired me to take part in leading, educating, and believing that we can make a change for the betterment of the Earth and human kind.
